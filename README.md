# ![Discord+](https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/blob/master/assets/wordmark_black.svg)
A Discord theme inspired by Google's Material Theme.

## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a popular messaging and voice chat service.

Using a modification called [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), you can change the look of the app, customize its behavior, and even add functionality through plugins! If you already have it installed, you're ready to install my theme. It's as easy as downloading a file and moving it to the right folder.

## User customization
This theme aims to be **fully customizable**.
There are variables at the top of the file that allow you to change things like the background image, the roundness of the UI, and the accent color. You can also change the fonts to any fonts installed on your device.

I am planning on introducing in-app settings, as soon as BetterDiscord allows for that.
In the meantime, you can edit the downloaded CSS file's variables to your liking.

## Complete theme
This theme aims to style everything on Discord.
If there's anything that is not themed, be it an official feature, a plugin, or third party feature, open an issue along with some information about the unthemed feature and I'll see what I can do.

I also use this theme myself, so if there's something's bugging you, it probably bugs me too. Expect quick updates if something big breaks. I do my best to keep up with Discord's BS.

## Cross-platform compatibility
The theme works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. There are some minor differences, though.
Windows has a draggable titlebar (with the Discord+ logo for good measure), macOS has window buttons at the top left, and Linux has your desktop environment's borders (which I cannot customize).

Compatibility with web browsers has been deprecated in v2.2.0 in favor of normalized classes through BandagedBD. This allows my theme to continue working, even if Discord refreshes all the class names. This also means legacy versions of BetterDiscord will no longer work with my theme.

# Download
https://rawgit.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/master/DiscordPlus-master.theme.css
This file always loads the latest version so you don't have to. To download it, open the context menu and click "Save as..." Instructions on how to install below. It's compatible with all future versions, though if I add new variables you'll need to update to change their values.

If you for whatever reason are a masochist who likes to keep old, defunct versions of things, download it from here:

https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/releases/latest
This link takes you to the latest release. These are released very rarely, and are therefore rendered obsolete almost immediately after release. Please consider using `DiscordPlus-master.theme.css` instead so you always have the latest commits delivered to your front door.

If neither of these two work for you, feel free to open an issue and describe the problem and I'll try to help you.

# Disclaimer
I am an independent developer with a real life. As a student, I prioritize working on real-life projects over this. That doesn't mean I'm abandoning the theme, but I'm much less likely to fix something that's broken if it doesn't directly affect me or my friend's usage of Discord. If you want to help, consider opening issues for things you want to see added or fixed, or contribute directly by making pull requests.
