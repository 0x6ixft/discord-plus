# Discord+
A Discord theme inspired by Google's Material Design 2.

## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a popular messaging and voice chat service.

Using plugins like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) or [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), you can change the look of the app.

## User customization
This theme aims to be **fully customizable**.
There are variables at the top of the file that allow you to change things like the background image, the roundness of the UI, and the accent color. You can also change the font to any font installed on your device.

## Full support
This theme aims to theme everything on Discord.
If there's anything that is not themed, be it an official feature, a plugin, bug or third party feature, open an issue along with some information about the unthemed feature.
The theme supports the light theme out of the box too, if that's your thing.
