# ![Discord+](https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/blob/master/assets/wordmark_black.svg)
A Discord theme inspired by Google's Material Theme.

## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com), a popular messaging and voice chat service.

Using plugins like [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.net/home/) or [BandagedBD](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp), you can change the look of the app.

## User customization
This theme aims to be **fully customizable**.
There are variables at the top of the file that allow you to change things like the background image, the roundness of the UI, and the accent color. You can also change the fonts to any fonts installed on your device.

I am planning on introducing in-app settings, as soon as BetterDiscord allows for that.
In the meantime, you can edit the downloaded CSS file's variables to your liking.

## Full support
This theme aims to theme everything on Discord.
If there's anything that is not themed, be it an official feature, a plugin, bug or third party feature, open an issue along with some information about the unthemed feature.
The theme supports the light theme out of the box too, if that's your thing.

_(Note: I cannot guarantee the light theme's continued support. Due to the vast unpopularity of the light theme, I will prioritize theming the dark version of Discord for now. I apologize to those affected.)_

## Cross-platform compatibility
The theme works on Windows, macOS, Linux and the Web. There are some minor differences, though.
Windows has a draggable titlebar (with the Discord+ logo for good measure), macOS has window buttons at the top left, and Linux has your desktop environment's borders (which I unfortunately cannot customize).

By the way, the theme is fully compatible with web extensions like Stylus, so you can use it with discordapp.com, no modifications needed!


# Download
https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/releases/latest

This link takes you straight to the latest release. These are released whenever I feel I've made enough modifications to warrant a new version tag.

Note: Since this is only updated after I'm satisfied with a set of revisions, it may not work on the latest version. If that's the case, download `DiscordPlus.theme.css` directly from the master branch. If it still doesn't work, feel free to open an issue.

* Type `%AppData%\BetterDiscord\themes` in the address bar
* Paste it here (Ctrl + V)
* Launch Discord
* Enable the theme in Settings

## **macOS**:
