## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com). It's both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is balancing between looks and performance.

All you need to install my theme is [BandagedBetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest). If you already have it installed, you're ready to install my theme! It's as easy as downloading a file and moving it to the right folder.

## User customization
This theme is **fully customizable**.
The variables at the top of the file allow you to change things like the background image, the accent color, and the roundness of the UI. You can also change the fonts to any fonts installed on your device.

For reference, this is what Discord+ looks like by default.

And this is how it would look like if you stylized it after [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net).

If you're not feeling creative, you could change the background image to cardboard and set the font to Comic Sans MS.
