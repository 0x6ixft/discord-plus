## What is this?

**Discord+** is a theme for [Discord](https://discordapp.com). It's both sleek and customizable, without getting in your way. Its top priority is balancing between looks and performance.

All you need to install my theme is [BandagedBetterDiscord](https://github.com/rauenzi/BetterDiscordApp/releases/latest). If you already have it installed, you're ready to install my theme! It's as easy as downloading a file and moving it to the right folder.

## User customization
This theme is **fully customizable**.
The variables at the top of the file allow you to change things like the background image, the accent color, the roundness of the UI, the fonts, and even the backdrop behind elements.

Check the [FAQ](https://github.com/PlusInsta/discord-plus/wiki/FAQ) for a full list of what you can do.

## Complete theme
Discord+ aims to style everything on Discord. If there’s anything that is not styled, be it an official feature, a plugin, or a third-party feature, open an issue along with some information and I'll see what I can do.
